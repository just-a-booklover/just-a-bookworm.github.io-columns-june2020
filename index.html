        <p id="psmall" style="font-size: 20px;">I'm bored because this morning I finished "Wuthering Heights" (in Italian -_-) and I've nothing else to read. Well, to be honest I do, but I hate to start a book the same day I've finished one. By the way I quickly decided to write about a topic :) .</p>

        <p>I started to watch them about a year ago and unwillingly: I don't like this kind of movies at all and I was annoyed because 2 of my friends were always trying to make me watch the Avengers series. But I can't say no, so I have been forced to watch them.</p>
        <p><strong>ONE OF THE BEST CHOICES I'VE EVER HAD!!!</strong></p>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/thumb/a/a6/The_Avengers_Logo.png/260px-The_Avengers_Logo.png" id="img" width="450" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px;">I know I'm dramatic, but it's true. I loved the movies (I mean- all but "Black Panther") and I also rewatched all of them.<br><span id="psmall" style="font-size: 20px;"> I've just discovered that in 2 webpages "Black Panther" has been voted as the best MCU movie. Now I'm shocked.</span><br>
        I swear, I wouldn't have watched all the movies another time if it weren't for my brother. I mean- they're like 53? hours. Suicide. My brother decided to get into MCU when I watched "Avengers: Endgame". First, he saw it, then he started with "Iron Man". That's weird. Luckily, we finished the Avengers series quite quickly because of the quarantine.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_Logo.png/310px-Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_Logo.png" id="img2" height="180" style="margin-left:-50px; margin-bottom: -31px; margin-right: -30px;"></p>
        <p>Despte everything, I've never watched a Marvel movie at the cinema -_- . I was really excited for the Black Widow's movie but eventually was delayed. I know they couldn't do otherwise, but I felt sad.</p>
        <p>Like a good reader, I would like to read the comics which inspired the productors. In February, I have been at a comicon and I wanted to buy a comic, but I couldn't decide which comic to buy and... I bought nothing. <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/it/thumb/6/66/AvengersEndgameMovie.png/260px-AvengersEndgameMovie.png" id="img" width="400" style="float: left; margin-right: 7px;">Next February I won't lose the chance. </p>
        <p>I also want to watch the X-Men series, but I would watch it with my brother, and he doesn't want to. By the way I'm still trying to convince him...</p>
